# Explore subdirectory organization for tickets

Investigate storing tickets in subdirectories organized by date, week, month, or other temporal groupings.

**Motivation:**
- Easier cleanup of old tickets
- More git-friendly (smaller diffs, better organization)
- Human-scannable directory structure

**Constraints:**
- No changes to existing behavior or command interfaces
- Ticket IDs and references should work as before
- Backwards compatible with flat .tickets/ structure

## Acceptance Criteria

- Research complete with documented pros/cons
- Prototype or design doc showing proposed structure
- Existing tests still pass (no behavior changes)
